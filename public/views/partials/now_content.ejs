<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Welcome to April, and welcome Spring!</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Health:</span> Huge news! My first mammogram and ultrasound were all good. No signs of cancer! Very, very happy about this.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="http://sonicpitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/pdun-mammo.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8477" src="http://sonicpitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/pdun-mammo.jpg" alt="pdun mammo" width="306" height="320" srcset="http://sonicpitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/pdun-mammo.jpg 306w, http://sonicpitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/pdun-mammo-100x105.jpg 100w, http://sonicpitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/pdun-mammo-200x209.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 306px) 100vw, 306px"></a></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">I’m struggling with nerve pain, and pain from tissue still healing and from radiation.&nbsp;We are working on medications to manage, but I am hopeful I won’t be taking any medications by the summer. My doctors feel that by this time tissue, nerve and radiation pain should settle down.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">It is also no secret that I put on 15 pounds over the last year. I am working on it with exercise and diet, but it has been bumming me out. Add fear and constant guilt, I decided it was time to meet with one of the UW Cancer Psychologists. What I am experiencing is not uncommon, so I am not ashamed to work on healing my headspace. It has been a tough grind over the past 6 years between this and Guillain Barre Syndrome. We’ll see.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Monty</span> is going in for his second shoulder surgery at the end of the month. To clarify, it’s the ‘other’ shoulder now. We expect he will be fine, but surgery and recovery is never fun. This is two years in a row one of us has had surgery on our Anniversary. I’m planning something fun for us next year.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Poker:</span> I had some poker success in March, including winning another $4200 PPC Aruba Package in November. Looking forward to playing a lot more locally this month. This will include the PPC $50k Guarantee at Ho Chunk/ Dells in mid April.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Ladies Poker Night:</span> We had our trial run at the end of March and it was so much fun. The gals were into it and caught on quickly. I saw lots of potential in our first group. Looking forward to keep on coaching and getting more gals into the game.</span></strong></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">I have a couple of spots left for our April class and our May (12th) class. If you or anyone you know is interested email me at pamela@pdubxo.com.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Fashion:</span> I’m 2 for 3 of my Spring Trends posts. It has been so cold for photoshoots, so my leather leggings came in handy for my Spring 2 shoot. I’m hoping to wear my ‘pretty dresses’ for Spring 3.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="http://sonicpitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Pamela-March-10.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-8513" src="http://sonicpitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Pamela-March-10-410x615.jpg" alt="Pamela-March-10" width="410" height="615" srcset="http://sonicpitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Pamela-March-10-410x615.jpg 410w, http://sonicpitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Pamela-March-10-830x1245.jpg 830w, http://sonicpitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Pamela-March-10-100x150.jpg 100w, http://sonicpitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Pamela-March-10-200x300.jpg 200w, http://sonicpitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Pamela-March-10-1250x1875.jpg 1250w" sizes="(max-width: 410px) 100vw, 410px"></a></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">More Fashion:</span> Save the ‘date’ for an ‘iona Reunion: Fall Fashion &amp; Beauty’ review this September at Arch! Just like old times. Would love to see some of you I haven’t seen since I closed iona.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Opinion Piece:</span> I’m working on an opinion piece called “I Used to be a Hugger’. In this I discuss the practice of hugging people as a greeting/ goodbye. For me (and Monty) it is now a painful gesture so I’ve changed how I say hello. I would love to interview a few people and get your opinion as well. Do you have 10 minutes to discuss, let me know. Email me at pamela@pdubxo.com</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Community:</span> We are making progress in establishing our fund for breast cancer patients in need. We have a bunch of meetings lined up, and should hopefully have our fund set up by the end of the month.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Travel:</span> Monty &amp; I are headed to St Simons Island, GA to visit my Mom &amp; Dad in mid April. We are looking forward to seeing them, and the weather should be nice. We are staying at the beach this trip, so it should be a little mini-vacation as well.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Let me know if you have any comments or questions about anything I’m doing to pamela@pdubxo.com , xo Pdub</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;"><strong>Update March 2016</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Poker:</strong> Vegas was exhausting! We met with moderate poker success in the tournaments, but were unsuccessful gambling in everything else. Vegas has a 4 day max moving forward.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Upcoming Tournaments:</strong> We’re keeping it pretty regional for a bit. We may be heading to Council Bluffs, IA early next month for another WSOP event. TBD.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Ladies Poker Night:</strong> I can’t wait for this. I’m teaching some poker lessons for the gals at my favorite beauty spot <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="http://www.archapothecary.com/pages/madison" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.archapothecary.com/pages/madison', '‘Arch Apothecary’']);" style="color: #0000ff;" target="_blank">‘Arch Apothecary’</a>,</span> </strong>starting this month. It’s going to be a very fun environment and looking forward to getting more ladies in the game. More details to come, but if you or someone you know is interested in our upcoming April class, let me know. (March class is full)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Fashion:</strong> Also super excited about this announcement. I have a Guest Contributor to Pdubxo.com coming this month. She is a LA Celebrity Stylist and you are going to love to hear her insight.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://sonicpitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/guest.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-8427" src="http://sonicpitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/guest-410x144.png" alt="guest" width="410" height="144" srcset="http://sonicpitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/guest-410x144.png 410w, http://sonicpitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/guest-100x35.png 100w, http://sonicpitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/guest-200x70.png 200w, http://sonicpitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/guest.png 437w" sizes="(max-width: 410px) 100vw, 410px"></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">Additionally my final 2 Spring Trends posts are on the way. And thanks for the kind feedback, I haven’t modeled in over 25 years.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Health Update:</strong> It has been one year since I was first diagnosed with breast cancer. What a year. Towards the end of the month I have my first mammogram screening. I’m super nervous but my oncologist gave me reassurances that everything is expected to be fine.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">I have also started the <strong>Couch to 5k</strong> running program. It’s so nice to get outside and get moving. The reality is that this is likely going to take me 20 weeks vs the 9 week plan, but that’s ok. I’m trying.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://sonicpitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/c25k-e1457652700793.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-8428" src="http://sonicpitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/c25k-410x547.png" alt="c25k" width="410" height="547"></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Community &amp; Social Change:</strong> Monty &amp; I have been working as advisors for a local group called <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/uwmadisonbundleup/?fref=ts" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.facebook.com/uwmadisonbundleup/?fref=ts', '‘Bundle Up’']);" style="color: #0000ff;" target="_blank">‘Bundle Up’</a>,</strong></span>&nbsp;who arein the works of becoming non-profit status. The organization was started and is operated by an amazing young man, Oliver Lees, a UW Student. The objective of the organization is to provide our homeless community with items to keep them warm during our cold winter months. We are proud to be helping Oliver &amp; his team, and looking forward to helping his organization grow and help our homeless community.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">We are also working on directing some of our fundraising efforts to provide support to breast cancer patients. I found through chatting with many patients during my treatment, that <strong>so many women were put in very difficult situations financially as a result of dealing with their cancer</strong>: lost wages, day to day bills, paying for things not covered by insurance such as lymphedema sleeves. These financial worries just add another huge layer of stress while dealing with the stress of treatment. Monty &amp; I talked about it and are going to help. More to come on that.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">Looking forward to catching up with friends this month too. Let me know if you have any questions, comments or would like to chat about any of the things that ‘I’m Doing Right Now’. xo Pdub</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;">Update February 2016</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Poker:</strong> Currently I am training for some upcoming Poker Tournaments; <strong><em>The Mid States Poker Tour</em></strong> on Feb 19-21st, and then heading to Vegas on the 25th for 10 days for the <em><strong>WSOPC (World Series of Poker Circuit Event)</strong></em> at Bally’s. I’ll be traveling with my husband Monty, and our friends, Poker Pro Mark ‘P0ker H0’ Kroon, and his super cool mom Marilyn ‘Momma H0’.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://sonicpitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/poker-crew.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-8268" src="http://sonicpitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/poker-crew-410x338.png" alt="poker crew" width="410" height="338" srcset="http://sonicpitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/poker-crew-410x338.png 410w, http://sonicpitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/poker-crew-100x82.png 100w, http://sonicpitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/poker-crew-200x165.png 200w, http://sonicpitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/poker-crew.png 733w" sizes="(max-width: 410px) 100vw, 410px"></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Monty ‘Uncle Gringo’ Schmidt, &nbsp;Mark ‘P0ker H0′ Kroon, &nbsp;Marilyn “Momma H0’ Guess, &nbsp;Pamela ‘Pdub’ Wilson</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">I’m physically working on getting in shape as well through exercise and diet. I’ve been&nbsp;alcohol free since the beginning of the new year intended to continue until our Vegas trip, but I had a couple of cheat cocktails in January. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">I’m going to Occupational Therapy every week to help manage my Lymphedema and pain. Sitting at a poker table for extended hours, day after day, in pain, is miserable. So working on that.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Fashion:</strong> I am working on a spring trends report/ photoshoot. As well I am working on finding a photographer to up my game, but stick with my style. Hoping to creatively work with someone asap.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Opinion &amp; Social Change:</strong> I am floored by the outpouring of feedback from my <em><strong><a href="http://sonicpitch.com/barely-surviving-breast-cancer-2/" target="_blank">‘Barely Surviving Breast Cancer.</a></strong></em>‘ post. I am in the midst of thinking through/ working on some other meaningful and important essays.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">Kind of enjoying being a housewife, cooking healthy food, organizing our home and catching up with friends.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also working on building my audience through<strong> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pdubxo/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.instagram.com/pdubxo/', 'Instagram&nbsp;']);" target="_blank">Instagram&nbsp;</a></strong>(not that easy to find ‘real’ followers), and building blog readership.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">I’ll keep you posted! Thanks for checking in. Let me know if you have any comments or questions <strong>pamela@pdubxo.com</strong></span></p>
